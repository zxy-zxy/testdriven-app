### Microservices with Docker, Flask and React

This repo is based on [testdriven course](https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/).

I've used the twelve-factor app pattern as we develop and design each microservice.

Along with twelve-factor, i've also practiced with test-driven development (TDD), writing tests first when it makes sense to do so. 
The focus will be on server-side unit, functional, and integration tests, 
client-side unit tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the entire system works as expected.
